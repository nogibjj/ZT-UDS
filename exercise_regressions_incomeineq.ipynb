    "# Estimating Gender Discrimination in the Workplace\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we'll use data from the 2018 US Current Population Survey (CPS) to try and estimate the effect of being a woman on workplace compensation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our focus will be *only* on differential compensation in the work place, and as a result it is important to bear in mind that our estimates are not estimates of *all* forms of gender discrimination. For example, these analyses will not account for things like gender discrimination in terms of *getting* jobs. We'll discuss this in more detail below."

The file is called `morg18.dta` and is a Stata dataset. Additional data on the dataset can be found by following the links in the README.txt file in the folder, but for the moment it is sufficient to know this is a national survey run in the United States.\n",

    "As noted above, this analysis will miss many forms of gender discrimination. For example, in dropping anyone who isn't working, we immediately lose any women who couldn't get jobs, or who chose to lose the workforce because the wages they were offered (which were likely lower than those offered men) were lower than they were willing / could accept. And in focusing on full time employees, we miss the fact women may not be offered full time jobs at the same rate as men. "

    "Fixed effects are a method used when we have a nested data structure in which respondents belong to groups, and those groups may all be subject to different pressures. In this context, for example, we can add fixed effects for the industry of each respondent—since wages often vary across industries, controlling for industry is likely to improve our estimates. Use `ind02` to control for industry.\n",

    "(Note that fixed effects are very similar in principle to hierarchical models. There are some differences [you will read about](../fixed_effects_v_hierarchical.ipynb) for our next class, but they are designed to serve the same role, just with slightly different mechanics). \n",
    "\n",
    "When we add fixed effects for groups like this, our interpretation of the other coefficients changes. Whereas in previous exercises we were trying to explain variation in men and women's wages *across all respondents*, we are now effectively comparing men and women's wages *within each employment sector*. Our coefficient on `female`, in other words, now tells us how much less (on average) we would expect a woman to be paid than a man *within the same industry*, not across all respondents. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that running this regression will result in lots of coefficients popping up you don't care about. We'll introduce some more efficient methods for adding fixed effects that aren't so messy in a later class -- for now, you can ignore those coefficients!)"
